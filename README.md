## Snakemake 

To run snakemake, first setup your snakemake
conda environment

`mamba create -f envs/snakemake-8.20.3.yaml`

Execute the pipeline interactively by running

`snakemake -j1 --use-conda`

or in the queue by running

`sbatch snake_manager.sh`

## Nextflow

To run nextflow, we can use SEDNA's nextflow
conda environment

`mamba activate nextflow-24.04.4`

Execute the pipeline interactively by running

`nextflow -c nf.config.NOAA_SEDNA run main.nf -entry QC`

or in the queue by running

`sbatch nextflow_job.sh`
